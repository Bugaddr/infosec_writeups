To solve the **Quiet Leak** challenge, we must analyze the network traffic to identify how data is being exfiltrated. The provided PCAP trace shows a series of **DNS over HTTPS (DoH)** queries directed at `dns.google`.

### Analysis of the Exfiltration Method

The netrunner is hiding data within the `POST` request bodies of DoH queries. Each relevant packet contains a base64-encoded string followed by the domain `doh.tcs.com`.

A critical observation is the single character preceding each base64 string, which acts as a **sequence marker** to ensure the data can be reassembled in the correct order. These markers include characters like `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`, `:`, `;`, `<`, and `=`.

### Identifying the Flag Fragments

By isolating the queries with sequence markers `4` through `7`, we find the components of the flag:

| Sequence Marker | Base64 Fragment | Decoded Content | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `4` | `SFFYe2U0M2NkOTlk` | <br>`HFX{e43cd99d` |  |
| `5` | `YmE1ZDdlYTA` | <br>`ba5d7ea0` |  |
| `6` | `Y2VjNzhlOGU` | <br>`cec78e8e` |  |
| `7` | `YzMxYzUzOWN9` | <br>`c31c539c}` |  |

### Other Exfiltrated Data

The remaining sequences (`8` through `=`) reveal that the netrunner also exfiltrated a list of sensitive system files, likely to distract from the flag fragments:

* 
**8**: `/etc/hosts` 


* 
**9**: `/etc/crontab` 


* 
**:**: `/etc/passwd` 


* 
**;**: `/var/log/auth.log` 


* 
**<**: `/home/user/.bash_history` 


* 
**=**: `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`

### Final Flag

Combining the fragments from sequences 4, 5, 6, and 7 results in the full credential:

**`HFX{e43cd99dba5d7ea0cec78e8ec31c539c}`**

**Would you like me to analyze the other exfiltrated files or look for more hidden noise in the pcap?**
